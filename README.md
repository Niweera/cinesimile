Visit <a href = "https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest<a/> and check out how to contribute to open source and become an open source hero! üòÅ
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, they invite us to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects.
## About The Project

CineSimile is a platform where you can find similar movies for a given movie. Currently, we are in the phase of finding similarity between the movies. So keep in touch, and we'll let you know.

### Machine Learning

Cinesmile is powered by machine learning to enhance the search capabilities and find a closer fit to your movie of choice. Similar technology is used by Netflix and Youtube to tailor recommendations to your personal choices.

### Technology Used

- Carbon Design System - https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon

- React - https://reactjs.org/

- Docker - https://www.docker.com/why-docker

## Getting Started

Thank you for showing interest in CineSimile, an open sourced platform to find similar movies for a given movie.

## üê≥ Run through Docker (Optional)

If interested in learning more about docker. [Docker Introduction](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

1. Execute the command below if you have the Docker CLI in your machine or server:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Open in your browser.


   ```sh

   ```
   Do the follow steps to use the Portainer:
   1. You'll need to create a password for local admin account.
   2. Choose the option: "**Docker** _manage the local Docker environment_".
   3. Done, you're now able to manage the containers


## Additional Information

9. If you are creating a new pull request please update your fork.

   ```bash
   $ git pull upstream master
   ```

Do this before creating another pull request. By doing this, your fork will be up-to-date with the main repository.

## Running E2E Tests üß™

1.  Running Tests Manually Using Cypress Test Runner

    ```bash
    npm run cy:run_in_dev
    ```

    Note: If the app server is already running, run: `npm run cy:open`

2.  Running All Tests in Headless Mode

    ```bash
     npm run cy:run_in_ci
    ```

    Note: If the app server is already running, run: `npm run cy:run`

3.  Running Specific Test in Headless Mode

    ```bash
    // replace <test_name> with the test file name

    npm run cy:run --spec "cypress/integration/<test_name>.spec.js"
    ```
